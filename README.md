# Website Template - NO BOOTSTRAP

After some (*ok, more than just "some"*) frustration getting Bootstrap to cooperate on a number of issues:

* Not all browsers produce the same results
* Bootstrap CSS is an excellent CSS framework, but too complicated for basic needs
* I'm tired of it lol

## The Result

After some research, experimentation, and playing around I put together what you see in this repository. Before I even started I had some expectations to fill:

* Must be responsive
* Must work, the navigation menu must operate and select targets.

It was also quite frustrating just *finding* **working** examples of a non-Bootstrap "responsive" page with a navigation menu. Too often I'd find something that(*pick one or more of the following...*):

* Did not work at all
* Was not truly "responsive"
* The "code" was poorly written and/or disorganized
* The author didn't test their work

So, here's what I've got now...

## Details

There are three *essential* files:

* `index.html`
* `nobs.css`
* `nobs.js`

The rest are related to favicon images.

### Navigation

### Responsiveness

### Extras
