<h1 style="text-align:center;">Website Template - NO BOOTSTRAP<h1>

# Overview

This repository contains a website *template*. It is intended as a starting point for the primary page of a website.

# Purpose

The intent is to make it easier and quicker to create a website *without using Boostrap*.  

I wanted a *basic*, *simple* and *working* website template. It had to have a navigation bar and be *responsive*... it seems that everyone has a different definition of what *resposive* actually means. 

After some (*ok, more than just "some"*) frustration getting Bootstrap to cooperate on a number of issues:

* Not all browsers(or platforms!) produce the same results
* Bootstrap CSS is an excellent CSS framework, but too complicated and too much overhead for basic needs
* I'm tired of it lol

## The Result

After some research, experimentation, and playing around I put together what you see in this repository. Before I even started I had some expectations to fill:

* Must be responsive
* Must work, the navigation menu must operate and select targets
* Must work with or without the "logo" component of the navigation bar
* Must be usable as a *basic* starting point for other projects

It was also quite frustrating just *finding* **working** examples of a non-Bootstrap "responsive" page with a navigation menu. Too often I'd find something that(*pick one or more of the following...*):

* Did not work at all
* Was not truly "responsive"
* The "code" was poorly written and/or disorganized
* The author didn't test their work

So, here's what I've got now... (*although it's more like a framework*)
