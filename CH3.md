# Desktop vs Mobile

This part is always a "gotcha" for me. One of the more frustrating tasks has been getting the whole "Desktop Vs Mobile" thing right. And my nemesis is *Firefox mobile*. The funny thing is I like the desktop version and use it for my everyday browsing. And I use Chrome desktop for development.

## Browsers Used for Testing

| **Browser** | Chrome  | Firefox |   Edge  |  Opera  | Safari  |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| **Desktop** |    Y    |    Y    |    Y    |    Y    |    N    |
| **Mobile**  |    Y    |    Y    |    Y    |    Y    |    N    |

Desktop: Windows 10, 64bit, Pro, current version.
Mobile: Android 12, Pixel 5a

Sorry, I haven't been able to test with Safari or with the other browsers on Linux, or on Microsoft devices. I you (*the reader :)*) are using any of those please take some screen shots and place them in an issue in this repository. Thanks!
